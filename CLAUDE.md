# flatex-fetch

## Project Status

Go CLI that logs into flatex.at and downloads document-archive PDFs.

**Live portal verification:** login, listing, download, and windowed
listing across a wide date range are all confirmed working against a real
flatex.at account (2026-07-16; windowing confirmed correct 2026-07-21 —
`TestE2EWindowedListingAndDownload` listed 235 documents across the last
year from 4 sub-windows in 27s, and downloaded one using its own
`WindowFrom`/`WindowTo`). Getting here took two live-caught bugs on the
way: a too-wide single query can come back silently empty (no table
rendered at all, detected via a missing `tableMarker`), and a capped
response doesn't reliably show the UI's own cap-warning text (a live run
trusting that text alone silently missed real documents — row count
hitting `capLimit`, 100, is the reliable signal). `windowedDocuments`
always tries the full requested range first and only splits on one of
those two signals, so the request count adapts to what the portal actually
needs (4 for this account/range) rather than a guessed fixed size. The
portal's "load more" control (`fieldRetrieveMore` in markup.go) was tried
first and abandoned — two separate live failures, documented in
`TestE2EPagination`; nothing production uses it.

## Build

    go build -o flatex-fetch

## Test

    go test ./...                 # unit tests (httptest mock backend, no real account)
    go test -race ./...           # what CI runs
    FLATEX_E2E_USER=... FLATEX_E2E_PASS=... go test -tags e2e ./internal/portal/   # live portal, manual only

## Release

Tag `v*` → `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds darwin/linux/windows ×
amd64/arm64 and attaches binaries to the GitHub release.

## Notes

- CLI flags/env vars/behavior are documented in two places: `main.go`'s
  `-help` text (canonical) and `README.md` (Usage/Setup/ENVIRONMENT). Update
  both in the same change — this has drifted before. Don't add a third copy
  (e.g. a full `-help` dump in the README).
- `internal/portal/markup.go` holds every portal-derived constant (paths,
  form fields, combobox indices, regexes). Filter comboboxes are numeric
  indices, not stable IDs — if flatex reorders a dropdown, fix it there.
- Portal requests are paced (~750ms) — don't "optimize" that away, it's
  bot-detection avoidance.
- Credentials: `~/.config/flatex-fetch/credentials.enc`, master passphrase
  via prompt or `FLATEX_FETCH_PASSPHRASE`.
